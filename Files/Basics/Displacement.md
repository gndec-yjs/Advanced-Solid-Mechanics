### Displacement

Displacement is a fundamental concept that is used to describe the change in position of a point or an object relative to a reference point or origin.  It is used in physics, engineering and other fields.  It is often used in the study of mechanics, which is concerned with the motion of objects and the forces that act upon them. In engineering, it is used to describe the deformation of structures and the behaviour of waves and vibrations.  In civil engineering, displacement is used to describe the deformation of structures under load, such as bridges and buildings.  In the case of the study of waves and vibrations, displacement refers to the distance between the rest position and the position of a particle or object that is vibrating or oscillating.  This displacement can be described using a number of different parameters, including amplitude, frequency, and wavelength.

Engineers use displacement measurements to determine the strain and hence the level of stress and  on a structure, which can help them to design efficiently and safer, by making the structures resilient.  Displacement can be measured in three dimensions, and it is typically denoted by the symbol "u".

It is a vector quantity, which means that it has both magnitude and direction.  The magnitude of displacement is given by the distance between the final and initial positions of the object, while the direction is given by the line connecting these two points. The path from initial to final position denotes the direction of displacement. 

A body is said to undergo rigid body displacement if the distance between any two particles that belongs to the same body remains unchanged. In a rigid body displacement, the particles that belong to a body do not move relative to each other. A body is said to be rigid if it always undergoes only rigid body displacement under action of any force. On the other hand, a body is said to be deformable if it allows relative displacement of its particles under the action of some force. Though, all real bodies are deformable, for making the system easy to understand and analyse it easily, body is treated as rigid under the action of forces.
