### Stress field

Stress refers to the internal force per unit 
area acting in a material in response to an 
external load or force. It is a tensor 
quantity, and is denoted using the symbol 
"Ïƒ".

The stress field is an important parameter in 
the study of material behaviour, and is used 
to describe the elastic and plastic 
deformation of materials. The stress field 
can be calculated using a number of different 
methods, including finite element analysis, 
which involves dividing a material into 
smaller elements and solving for the stress 
in each element.


The theory of stress fields can be applied to various strengthening mechanisms for materials. Stress fields can be created by adding different sized atoms to the lattice (solute strengthening). If a smaller atom is added to the lattice a tensile stress field is created. The atomic bonds are longer due to the smaller radius of the solute atom. Similarly, if a larger atom is added to the lattice a compressive stress field is created. The atomic bonds are shorter due to the larger radius of the solute atom. The stress fields created by adding solute atoms form the basis of the material strengthening process that occurs in alloys.
