### Strain field

The strain field is a vector field that 
describes the distribution of strain within a 
material. It is a fundamental parameter in 
the study of material behaviour, and is used 
to describe the elastic and plastic 
deformation of materials. The strain field 
can be calculated using a number of different 
methods, including finite element analysis.

It is used in a wide range of applications, 
from materials science and engineering to 
geology and seismology.

The strain field pattern recognition also known 
as strain mapping, is used by structural health 
Monitoring which is based on strain measurement 
gathered through a network of sensors I.e(strain 
gauges and fiber optic sensors such as distributed
sensing).
