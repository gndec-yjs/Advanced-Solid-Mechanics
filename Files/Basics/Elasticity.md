### Elasticity

Elasticity refers to the property of a material to deform under an applied load and then return to its original shape and size when the load is removed. Materials that exhibit this property are called elastic materials.

The response of an elastic material to an applied load is characterized by its stress-strain relationship, which describes how the material deforms under stress. When a small stress is applied to an elastic material, it will deform by a small amount, known as strain, and the relationship between stress and strain is linear. This linear relationship is known as Hooke's Law, which states that stress is proportional to strain within the elastic limit of the material.

The elastic limit of a material is the maximum amount of stress it can sustain before it begins to deform permanently, which means it does not return to its original shape and size when the load is removed. Beyond the elastic limit, the material exhibits plastic deformation, and its stress-strain relationship becomes nonlinear.
