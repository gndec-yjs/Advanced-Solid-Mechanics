### Strain

Strain is defined as the ratio of the change
in length of the material to the original
length of the material.  It is expressed as
a percentage or a decimal value, and is
denoted using the symbol "ε".  Strain is a
dimensionless quantity, meaning that it has
no units.
Strain is neither  scaler nor vector quatity.
It is a tensor quantity.

There are several types of strain, including
axial strain, shear strain, and volumetric strain. 
Axial strain :It refers to the change in length of 
an object that is subjected to an applied force or 
load. The change can be tensile or compressive in nature.
The positive value of starin indicates the tensile
strain and negative value indicates the compressive
strain . 
Shear strain: It refers to the change in shape of 
an object due to twisting or shearing forces. 
Volumetric strain, on the other hand, refers
to the change in volume of an object in
response to a load or force.

Poission's ratio:When the pulling or pushing on an 
object is applied in one direction then the 
deformations occured in all the orthogonal directions.
For example:When a rod is pulled along the 
X-direction, then the decrease  in the dimensions
 of rod will occured in Y and Z directions.This property
of the material is known as poission's ratio. Denoted 
by letter(ν) called (nu).
Poission's ratio(ν) =-(lateral strain/longitudinal strain)
Here negative sign indicates the decrease in dimension.
Units of poision's ratio: Unitless quantity . Because
 it is a ratio of strains which is a unitless quantity.
Range of poissiin's ratio: -1 to 0.5

Strain is an important parameter in the
study of material behaviour, and is used to
describe the elastic and plastic deformation
of materials.Strain parameter is used to determine 
the durability of the material .
